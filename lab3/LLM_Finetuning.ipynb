The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n",

You will use this to define a custom metric that uses the judge LLM to evaluate text for how well it adheres to Yoda speak. Note that the judge LLM and the metric can be applied to any text, not just the outputs of the model.
